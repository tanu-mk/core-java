	//purpose of Abstraction - simplicity
	//Abstraction - hiding the implementation and allowing the user to access only the functionality
	//				with the help of interface
	
	//advantage - loose coupling
	

	//coupling types:
	//loose coupling - change in implementation which does not effect the user, achieved with the help of interface
	//tight coupling - change in implementation which effect the user
	
	

//encapsulation - grouping the data into single block
